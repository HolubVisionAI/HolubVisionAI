## 🧠 My Focus: Real-World AI That Delivers

I specialize in solving the “last-mile” problems in AI—where theory meets chaos.  
Whether it's dusty drones or edge devices in hospitals, I make vision work where it's needed most.

## 🛠️ Project Highlights

- 🚁 **Drone Traffic Monitoring**  
  Built for a smart-city initiative in Dubai. Reduced false alarms by **65%**, even in low-visibility sandstorms.

- 🧠 **MRI Model Compression**  
  Helped a U.S. healthcare team run deep models on Raspberry Pi—cutting cloud costs by **40%**.

- 🛒 **Retail Inventory Tracker**  
  Developed a YOLOv8 solution that saved **25+ manual hours/month** for a German retail client.

## 🤝 Why Teams Work With Me

- 🔧 **I fix what others can’t**  
  _“Ihor took our prototype that worked perfectly in the lab and made it functional in rain, low light, and crowds.”_

- 🗣️ **Clear communication, no jargon**  
  Weekly updates with visual walkthroughs and real results. Always transparent and aligned with goals.

- ⚖️ **Ethics-first AI**  
  Audited a facial recognition system and mitigated **12% demographic bias** before deployment.

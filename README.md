## 🧠 My Specialty: Solving the “Last-Mile” Problems

I build vision systems that thrive in messy, unpredictable environments.  
Here are a few highlights:

- 🚁 **Drone Traffic Monitoring** – Built for a Dubai smart-city project, reduced false alarms by 65% even in sandstorms.  
- 🧠 **MRI Model Compression** – Optimized a U.S. healthcare model to run on Raspberry Pi, slashing cloud costs by 40%.  
- 🛒 **Retail Inventory Tracker** – Developed a YOLOv8 system that cut manual checks by 25 hours/month for a German client.

## 🤝 Why Clients Work With Me

- 🔧 **I fix what others can’t:**  
  *“Ihor took our prototype that worked perfectly in the lab and made it functional in rain, low light, and crowds.”*

- 🗣️ **No jargon, just clarity:**  
  Weekly updates via Slack/Loom, always in plain English. Happy to deep dive—over coffee or kompot.

- ⚖️ **Ethics-first AI:**  
  Audited a facial recognition system and removed 12% bias against darker skin tones before deployment.
